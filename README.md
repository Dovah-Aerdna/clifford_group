# Clifford Generation

An investigation of Clifford group and Symplectic matrices in quantum computing using Julia (QuantumInformation.jl). 
The code to optimize the generation of an arbitrary Clifford group element was taken from "How to efficiently select an arbitrary clifford group element"
by Robert Koenig and John A. Smolin
